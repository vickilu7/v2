        <p class='h3' style='text-align: center;'>
          Together with my co-lead, we created designs and models to capture a rebranded
          identity for the HackDuke: Code for Good hackathon.

        <p class='small-title' style='text-align: left;'><subtitle>Understand</subtitle></p>
        <p class='h3'>Founded in 2012, HackDuke was the first collegiate hackathon to focus on creating solutions
          for social issues through technology.</p>
        <p>We unite over 600 students, hackers, and mentors
          who are passionate about changing the intention and narrative behind how tech is used today
          to create meaningful hacks in a 24-hour sprint.
        </p>
        <p>Students would create projects that solve problems in four predefined tracks: Inequality,
          Energy & Environment, Health & Wellness, and Education. We also had a mascot — a Russian
          Blue cat named HackKitty! Since then, HackDuke has grown so much in campus presence,
          starting the first conference in product design (IDEATE: A Design Thinking & Innovation Conference)
          as well as founding Catalyst– the first social & pre-professional tech-interest group.
        </p>
        <p>As a community, we realized that we’ve seen a lot of growth from every “first” and step
          we’ve taken along the way. This year, we wanted to focus our rebrand on not only all the
          paths we’ve created, but also all the possibilities we see moving forward.
        </p>
        <img src='team.jpg' style='width: 100%;'/>
      </div>

      <div class='project-section' id='Vision'>
        <p class='small-title' style='text-align: left;'><subtitle>The Vision</subtitle></p>
        <p>We began our process by thinking about HackDuke’s mission and what we wanted participants to get
          out of attending our event. It’s always been centered around our Code for Good motto and I believe
          the key difference that sets our hackathon apart from others is our dedication to this mission.
          We try to keep this in mind when planning the logistics of the event, for example:</p>
        <p>1. The prizes at HackDuke are amounts of money <b>donated to a charity</b> of the winner’s choice
        </p>
        <p>2. Our meals are only catered from <b>local vendors</b> and we donate leftovers to nearby <b>shelters</b></p>
        <p>3. We enforce participants to work in one of the 4 unique project tracks, which enable members
          to partner with peers, local organizations, nonprofits and universities to <b>work towards a
          cause that matters</b></p>
        <p>4. We give out <b>reusable water bottles</b> to participants instead of buying disposable plastic bottled water</p>
        <p>
          All of these small details are really just to improve participant experience and immerse them
          in an environment of thinking about what it means to use technology for social good. We want
          them to create impactful projects that explore ideas out of their comfort zone and that will
          extend beyond this weekend. Hackers shouldn’t just grow in technical ability over this weekend,
          but also should grow as an individual who contributes to their community.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class='project-section' id='Identity'>
        <p class='small-title' style='text-align: left;'><subtitle>Visual Identity</subtitle></p>
        <p class='h3'>Our rebrand centers around this idea of growth & exploration and our visual identity expresses
          this through travel.</p>
        <p>While travel quite obviously shows exploration, it also allows us to show
          the sub-ideas of: taking different pathways, the universal impact of tech, and how social good
          differs globally. We brainstormed lots of different looks...</p>
        <img src='identity-1.png' style='width: 100%;'/>
        <img src='identity-2.png' style='width: 100%;'/>
        <p>...and ultimately settled on a heavy use of white space with pops of color in geometric shapes.
          The photography + white line illustrations was a strong contender, but we realized we didn’t
          have many original photographs to use and thus wouldn’t be able to build a solid design vocabulary
          with reusable assets.</p>
      </div>

      <div class='project-section' id='Design-Vocab'>
        <p class='small-title' style='text-align: left;'><subtitle>Design Vocabulary</subtitle></p>
        <p>Besides keeping the core branding like our logo and mascot consistent, we changed just about
          everything else. In order to create a unified presentation, we established some guides.</p>
        <p class='h3'>Color Palette</p>
        <p>The color palette was inspired by the colors in the sky during sunrise and sunset with a
          good mix of warm and cool tones. Since these colors would be used against a white background,
          we focused more on making sure they look good as stand alone accent colors, but also
          in contrast with each other.
        </p>
        <img src='colors.png' style='width: 100%;'/>

        <p class='h3'>Fonts</p>
        <p>This was probably the most disorganized aspect of our redesign process since we were all so
          indecisive and didn’t unify our font choice until way later. You can see the various fonts
          we were considering down below.
        </p>
        <img src='fonts-1.png' style='width: 100%;'/>
        <p>In the end, we decided on Open Sans and Open Sans Bold for headings and larger text and PT Sans for body text.</p>
        <img src='fonts-2.png' style='width: 100%;'/>

        <p class='h3'>Visual Assets</p>
        <p>We decided to centralize on <b>travel and transportation</b> as a design motif. This was to represent
          exploration in a more literal sense and was a really fun theme for us to play around with.The two
          most important visual assets we used were the subway tracks and the assortment of colorful lines,
          circles, and squares.
        </p>
        <img src='va-1.png' style='width: 100%;'/>
        <p>Design vocabulary applied to our site landing page, icons, sponsorship documents, and flyers (post-card themed!)</p>
        <img src='va-2.png' style='width: 100%;'/>
        <img src='va-3.png' style='width: 100%;'/>
      </div>

      <div class='project-section' id='Online'>
        <p class='small-title' style='text-align: left;'><subtitle>Online</subtitle></p>
        <p class='h3'>Website Layout</p>
        <p>The website was our first major project and we were tasked to complete a full redesign within
          5 days over the summer in order to give the tech team enough time to code it before the school
          year started. For the most part, the layout would be conserved from last year and we were only
          changing the visual UI decisions.
        </p>
        <img src='website.png' style='width: 100%;'/>
        <p>We wanted to keep it a one page site, but also have a pathway going down the entire site to tie
          together the travel theme. One long subway track line was used to run down the left side of the
          page and each “stop” would be the title of the section on our site (About, Schedule, FAQs, etc…).
          We wanted to implement a non-continuous scroll to further give users the feeling of “arriving at
          the stop” when they scrolled through the site to a new section.
        <p>

        <p class='h3'>Stories</p>
        <p>Another main change we wanted to undertake was to further the Tracks section and have the 4
          track cards not just link to more information about them, but also to personal stories from
          our team members.
        </p>
        <p>One of our directors was inspired by her experience in an undeveloped country this past summer,
          where she got to see how technology could create a driving force for social good. She wanted
          to make the hackathon more personal by having others share similar experiences related to the
          four tracks. We didn’t get to implement this section of the site, but it’s something to keep in
          mind for following years for sure. Here’s what it would’ve looked like when someone clicked into
          a track on the main page.
        </p>
        <img src='stories.png' style='width: 100%;'/>

        <p class='h3'>Facebook Profile Videos</p>
        <p>Photoshoooooot. We thought it’d be fun to wear clothes in our color palette. I’d never done
          animation, but a past design team member offered to give us a small workshop on Adobe AfterEffects!
        </p>
        <img src='visual-3.png' style='width: 100%;'/>

        <p class='h3'>Poster Campaign</p>
        <p>Della and I really just wanted an excuse to use our lame travel puns.</p>
        <img src='posters.png' style='width: 100%;'/>

        <p class='h3'>HackKitty</p>
        <p>Thought it’d be really cute if each of the 4 track kitties and the main kitty had a travel
          type associated with it. This part probably doesn’t need a whole heading dedicated to it, but
          they’re just so adorable.
        </p>
        <p>Main kitty– astronaut; Health & Wellness– train conductor; Education– sailor;
          Inequality– flight attendant; Energy & Environment– pilot
        </p>
        <img src='hackkitty.png' style='width: 100%;'/>

        <p class='h3'>Workshop Series</p>
        <p>In 2014 HackDuke launched “From Scratch”, a week-long series of classes/crash-courses/workshops
          preceding the hackathon that taught students basic coding and design principles.
        </p>
        <p>This year we decided to bring that back and held workshops that ranged from topics like
          learning React to tech recruiting tips! I used a slightly different visual style for this
          marketing, using a more doodle illustration-like feel, but still making sure to incorporate
          our main visual subway line & colorful shapes assets.
        </p>

        <p class='small-title' style='text-align: left;'><subtitle>Day-Of</subtitle></p>
        <p>We might’ve gone overboard with HackKitty as seen by the banner and organizer apparel designs.
          To go along with the travel theme, we thought it’d be cool to make the participant badges look
          like train tickets. These also doubled up as a punch card for us to keep track of who got their
          meal already. On the back, we put some important logistical information.
