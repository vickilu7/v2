          How might we promote positive change among large organizations by using technology to increase efficiency and education?

        <p class='small-title' style='text-align: left;'><subtitle>The Challenge</subtitle></p>
        <p>Hierarchies and corporate policies in large organizations strongly dissuade micro-innovation.
          In addition, people simply just don’t have time to learn all the information to enact quality
          improvement. We want to level the playing field to allow anyone with an idea impact positive
          change in their workplace.

      <div class='project-section'>
        <p class='small-title' style='text-align: left;'><subtitle>Project Vision</subtitle></p>
        <p>The final product is a task-oriented web application that can help anyone fix problems they
          see in their workspace in a consistent and accessible manner. Workers can interact with the
          platform’s videos and activities to ultimately complete a project proposal form and submit it
          directly to the appropriate department.

          <p class='h3'>Quality improvement (QI) consists of systematic and continuous actions that lead to measurable
            improvement and is an integral component to delivering high-quality healthcare. </p>
          <p>However, QI is challenging, and with mounting day-to-day duties, healthcare workers struggle to find the time
            to learn proper skills to successfully affect change in their workplace.</p>
          <p>Duke Cancer Institute works closely with Duke University hospital system in both research as
            well as project initiatives. BiteSizeQI was created to teach and foster micro-innovation within
            large organizations, such as Duke hospital, which promotes small and positive changes.
            The best ideas don’t always come from the top and, when given the right tools, all staff
            can drive meaningful change. I worked as a UI/UX designer with a team of quality improvement
            experts, clinicians, programmers and researchers at Duke Cancer Institute to create BiteSize QI.

        <div class='project-section' id='Role'>
          <p class='small-title' style='text-align: left;'><subtitle>My Role</subtitle></p>
          <p>We actually joined in the middle of the project, so interest for Bitesize QI was already high,
            initial research was done, and an MVP had already been created. However, this prototype was basically
            just a series of videos (think required company on-boarding videos!) to watch and then a long proposal
            form to fill out afterwards. </p>
          <p>Our job was to evaluate the specific needs of various users, redesign the information architecture,
            convey key ideas in initial mockups, execute high-fidelity designs, and ultimately design a functional experience.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class='project-section' id='Needs'>
          <p class='small-title' style='text-align: left;'><subtitle>Needs</subtitle></p>
          <p class='h3'>Bitesize QI needed a redesigned user experience that would save time and streamline the purpose of the tool.</p>
          <p>These are the key points we established were needed to accomplish this goal:</p>
          <p><b>1. Navigation:</b> Implement a seamless navigation system that demonstrates progress indication and how to jump back in</p>
          <p><b>2. Experience:</b> Create an intuitive web experience that eliminates unnecessary steps and is supported by smooth interactions</p>
          <p><b>3. Learning:</b> Highlight essential features through contextual help that improves understanding of the product</p>
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class='project-section' id='Research'>
          <p class='small-title' style='text-align: left;'><subtitle>Research</subtitle></p>
          <p>Looking at the initial research, we separated user types into two categories: Primary users, like employees who would
            benefit directly but aren’t actively engaged in quality improvement decisions. Secondary users, like
            management staff who ultimately make these decisions, but aren’t well informed or have the time to do it well.
            Using this information, we developed <b>user personas</b>.</p>
          <img src='user-persona-2.png' style='width: 100%;'/>
          <img src='user-persona-1.png' style='width: 100%;'/>
          <p>We restructured the <b>information architecture</b> centered around a dashboard navigation that walks
            the users through step-by-step in order to minimize attention loss as well as information loss.
            In order to move onto the next video and lesson, you need to complete the activity, which also self populates the blueprint.
          </p>

        <div class='project-section' id='Visual'>
          <p class='small-title' style='text-align: left;'><subtitle>Visual</subtitle></p>
          <p>We started out with a few visual concepts and followed up during a review with the rest of the team.
            A lot of ideas were scrapped and I had to give up on gradients :( One of the most important skills
            to learn as a designer is how to move on from your designs and it’s definitely something i’m still working on.
            Based on a comment from a shareholder, we settled on the concept three that had a clean feel and
            pops of color to help keep attention on the tasks.
          </p>
          <p class='h3'>"The tool should have a professional/corporate approach while integrating the colorful and cartoonish nature of the videos.”

      <div class='project-section' id='How'>
        <p class='small-title' style='text-align: left;'><subtitle>How it Works</subtitle></p>
        <p class='h3'>BiteSize QI is a task-oriented web-based application that helps users identify a problem or deficiency in
          their workplace, and then walks the user through the fundamentals of quality improvement to help fix the problem.

        <!-- CAROUSEL FOR HOW IT WORKS -->
        <div class="slideshow-container">

          <div class="mySlides fade">
            <video controls="controls" autoplay muted loop width="800" name="welcome-mov" src="welcome.mov"></video>
            <p>Upon logging in, users are brought straight to a welcome video and can view their progression along
              the side navigation</p>
          </div>

          <div class="mySlides fade">
            <video controls="controls" autoplay muted loop width="800" name="solutions-mov" src="solutions.mov"></video>
            <p>Users will work their way through a series of short videos that build their quality improvement skills.
              Concepts include how to create problem statements, effective timelines, and clear solutions.</p>
            <p>After completing a video, the system then engages the user to apply the skills they have
              learned by completing simple quality improvement activities.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="mySlides fade">
            <video controls="controls" autoplay muted loop width="800" name="toggle-mov" src="toggle.mov"></video>
            <p>I also noticed the excessive use of modal windows in the original prototype and felt it was inconvenient
              for users to constantly open and exit out of them. I created a toggle function on the activity screens
              to show example inputs for the users to get an idea of what they should be writing.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="mySlides fade">
            <video controls="controls" autoplay muted loop width="800" name="dashboard-mov" src="dashboard.mov"></video>
            <p>After the initial log-in, once a user logs in again, they will be brought directly to their dashboard.
              There, they can pick up where they left off, access the other activities, and view their work-in-progress
              project blueprint.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="mySlides fade">
            <video controls="controls" autoplay muted loop width="800" name="blueprint-mov" src="blueprint.mov"></video>
            <p>As a user completes each activity, the system records the progress made on the dashboard and builds a
              guide (Project Blueprint) for implementing a solution to the problem using the responses from the activities.</p>

        <p>BiteSizeQI is currently being used as the primary mode of quality improvement at Duke University Hospital,
          which is home to over 300 physicians and researchers. It is also being implemented in several neighboring
          healthcare systems as well as local businesses. We've received positive feedback regarding the ease and
          intuitive nature of the web-app from several users and I actually worked on another app with Duke Cancer
          Institute the following semester!</p>
